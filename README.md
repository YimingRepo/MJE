## Impacts of Exotic Saltmarsh Removal and Native Saltmarsh Restoration on Bed Level Change and Surficial Sediment Distribution in an Estuary Wetland

### Overview
This repository contains the data used in the study: **"Impacts of exotic saltmarsh removal and native saltmarsh restoration on bed level change and surficial sediment distribution in an estuary wetland."** The study focuses on the Minjiang Estuary and evaluates the effects of ecological restoration efforts on sediment dynamics and bed elevation changes.

### Contents
The data in this repository are organized into the following categories:

1. **Model Files**:
   - Input and configuration files for the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic simulations conducted using the Delft3D model.
   - Results of model simulations, including bed level changes and sediment distribution patterns.

2. **Field Observation Data**:
   - Core sample data from field surveys, detailing surficial sediment composition.
   - Bed elevation measurements collected at various locations in the Minjiang Estuary.
